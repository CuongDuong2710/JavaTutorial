INTERFACE

1. You can put fields in Interface but you have to understand that they are final (constants). They are never going to change

2. Method in interface is 'public' and 'abstract' so don't need to write.

3. Interface is just an empty class that provides or tells someone what methods they must implement if they want to use. 

ABSTRACT

1. Whenever you want to create a class in which every method doesn't necessarily have to be implemented to use abstract class.

2. There a no abstract fields.

3. All methods don't have to be abstract.

4. You can have static methods.

5. Abstract method doesn't have body.

6. You cannot create an object from abstract class.
